{"text": "One method used widely to identify such transitions is based on statistical inference with respect to the likelihood function associated with observed values [1]. Another option is model selection through Bayesian statistics known as Baysian Model Selection (BMS), which has been introduced recently by others [2, 3 ]. Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses: while maximum probabilities allows arbitrary positivity constraints on the parameters involved, BMS can handle them easily but requires additional priors. Furthermore, when dealing with finite samples, both assume convergence towards the true parameter value distribution; however, BMS provides robustness against misspecification typically without imposing strong parametric assumptions (see Section 2). As such, BMS offers a valuable alternative to MLE under various conditions where weak regularity hypotheses must hold at each point along the horizon (e.g., stationary increments), which often cannot are verified empirically.", "label": "machine", "id": 93}
{"text": "This article proposes a solution to identifying local discontinuities, i.e., large jumps between two consecutive observations in a temps series, which complements existing procedures.

We call this procedure MODEST because \"Mode Detection Estimation Switching Testing.\" Although similar ideas ai appeared previously [4] 6], they did so with focus on stochastic models involving independent variables such as ARCH processes instead of queue lengths in queues.
